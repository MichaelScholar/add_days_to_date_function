Hi,
Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your recruitment process. In this repository you will find a proposed
solution to the task bellow:

"I would like you to write a function that receives a date and a number of days to add.
The function will need to calculate the new date taking into consideration the calendar
* Please, use Python to solve this task
** You can use datetime module if you want to ease date parsing, but donâ€™t use it for calculation algorithm"

I've also attached a "control" solution using a datetime format, as a part of the verification and the creative process.
